# Kiri:Moto

A Unique, Multi-Modal, Cloud-based Slicer

# Meta:Moto

Recursive Block-based Modeling

## Getting Started

```
npm update
npm start
```

to start a local instance of the apps. then open
[Kiri:Moto](http://localhost:8080/kiri) or
[Meta:Moto](http://localhost:8080/meta) on http://localhost:8080/

## Other Start Options

```
npm run-script start-web
```
serves code as obfuscated, compressed bundles. this is the mode used to run on a public
web site, so you can't use "localhost" to test. to accomodate this, alias "debug" to 127.0.0.1
then access the apps from http://debug:8080/
